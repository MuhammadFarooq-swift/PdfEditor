# Installation

To get started, you need to install both the high-level `@embedpdf/engines` package and a low-level engine like `@embedpdf/pdfium`.

## Default installation

You can install them from `npm` using your preferred package manager:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @embedpdf/engines @embedpdf/pdfium
````

That's it\! The packages are now installed in your project.

## Next Steps

Now that you have the library installed, head back to the **[Introduction](./introduction.md)** to see how to set it up and start using it in your application.
